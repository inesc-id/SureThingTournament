# Vulnerability analysis part

Vulnerability analysis is the process of analyzing a system for vulnerabilities.
The process first consists in the identification of any present vulnerabilities, where each vulnerability is prioritized in terms of its risk.
At last those identified vulnerabilities can be mitigated by removing them.

## Tools

As part of the [first round](../ "Attack round 1 folder"), players will have to perform vulnerability analysis using two different tools.

### Nmap

The first tool players have to use is Nmap.
The steps to install and use it, as well the goals players are required to achieve with it, are described in [its folder](1-Nmap "Nmap folder").

### OpenVAS

The second vulnerability analysis related tool is OpenVAS.
Again, its installation steps and how it should be used during this first round are described in [its folder](2-OpenVAS "Nmap folder").
