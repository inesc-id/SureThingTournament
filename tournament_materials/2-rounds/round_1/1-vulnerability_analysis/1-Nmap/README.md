# Nmap

[Nmap](https://nmap.org/ "Nmap website") (Network Mapper) is a port scanning tool.
Nmap does not only work as a network discovery and enumeration tool but also provide features such as a service and _Operating System_ detection.

<br>

## Installation

At this point Nmap should already be installed in the [machine of the attacker](../../../../1-setup/1-attacker_VM "Attacker machine setup folder"), as one can check [here](../../../../1-setup/5-tools/1-Nmap/##check-installation "Check Nmap installation section").

<br>

## Goals of using Nmap as a vulnerability analysis tool

Nmap will be used to discover any ports open at the [target system](../../../../0-rules/#target-system "Target System section").

<br>

## Usage

The basic port scan consists in providing the hostname or IP address(es) of the target(s).
A simple port scan for the virtual machine holding the CROSS-server would be:

```
# nmap -v 192.168.21.X
```

where `X` is the host address of CROSS-server virtual machine instance.

Running the command above without any additional parameters is the default scan.
Meaning Nmap would only scan the most commom 1000 TCP ports.

<br>

### Basic available parameters

Some of the other available commands are:

- `-A` to enable Opearating System detection, script scanning and traceroute;
- `-p` to scan specific ports, either a single one or a range of ports;
  - `-p-` omits both the begining and end port ranges, meaning a full ports scan (all 65535 ports).
- `-r` to scan ports consecutively;
- `-sV` to enable service detection on open ports, meaning Nmap will probe open ports to find the service and version running in each;
- `-Pn` to consider the target(s) as alive;
- `-sU` to perform an UDP scan;
- `-v` as usual, the verbose parameter, makes Nmap output more detailed information about the target(s).

**Note**: Nmap requires some port scans to run with elevated/root privileges.
