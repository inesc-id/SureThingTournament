# OpenVAS

[OpenVAS](https://openvas.org/ "Open Vulnerability Assessment System") is vulnerability scanning and management framework that provides several services and tools for that end.
It works by matching vulnerabilities found in the scanned system with known vulnerabilities.

<br>

## Installation

The following steps assume OpenVAS is already installed in the [machine of the attacker](../../../../1-setup/1-attacker_VM "Attacker machine setup folder"), following the [installation steps](../../../../1-setup/5-tools/2-OpenVAS "OpenVAS installation folder").

<br>

## Goals of using OpenVAS as a vulnerability analysis tool

OpenVAS offers its users the ability to run several vulnerability scans.
Players have to use OpenVAS to find existing vulnerabilities in the [target system](../../../../0-rules/#target-system "Target System section").

<br>

## Initialization

Each time one needs to use OpenVAS its service needs to be launched.
Running the following command will launch the OpenVAS service:

```bash
$ sudo gvm-start
```

Once the service is running, the web interface will be ready to use through the default port: **9392**.
Just open a browser and manually navigate to `https://127.0.0.1:9392`.
If it is the first time OpenVAS is used, the browser might ask to accept the self-signed certificate.
After logging in, it will show the main page:
![OpenVAS dashboards page][dashboards_page]

<br>

## Usage

The first step is to confirm the ports lists available by default.
In the menu, go to _Configuration_ > _Port Lists_.
There is always the option to add a new port list.
On the top-left corner, just below the _Dashboards_ menu tab, select the _New Port List_ button:
![Common new button icon][new_icon_button]

Add the information in the wizard window that opens:
![New port list window][new_port_list_wizard_window]

Next, it is time to add targets.
Go to _Configuration_ > _Targets_.
There, select the _New Target_ button:
![Common new button icon][new_icon_button]

Once the wizard window (_New Target_) opens insert the target details:
![New target window][new_target_wizard_window]

At the end click _Save_ to confirm the inserted data and close the window.
The added target should then be seen listed in the targets list.

The default scan configs can be seen by navigating to _Configuration_ > _Scan Configs_:
![Default scan configurations][default_scan_configurations]

Again, it is possible to add new ones.
Just click the _New Scan Config_ button at the top-left corner of the page:
![Common new button icon][new_icon_button]

The _New Scan Config_ wizard window will open up:
![New scan configuration window][new_scan_config_wizard_window]

Once all the configurations are setup, it is time to add vulnerability scans.
In web interface provided by OpenVAS, vulnerability scans are treated as "tasks".

Go to _Scans_ > _Tasks_.
Once in the _Tasks_ page, click the _New Task_ button:
![Common new button icon][new_icon_button]

This will launch a wizard window (_New Task_) where it is possible to insert all the relevant information for a scanning task:
![New task window][new_task_wizard_window]
To confirm, click _Save_ to close the window.

To run a task click the _Start_ button (![Start task button icon][start_task_icon_button]) of the corresponding _Actions_ column:
![Tasks actions buttons column][tasks_actions_buttons]

The page containing all reports of running the task(s) can be consulted by navigating to _Scans_ > _Reports_.
To refer to all gathered results go to _Scans_ > _Results_.
All detected vulnerabilities can be seen at _Scans_ > _Vulnerabilities_.
