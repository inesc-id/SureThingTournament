# Nmap installation

## Installation remarks

Considering Kali Linux was installed in the [attacker machine](../../1-setup/attacker_VM "Attacker machine setup folder"), following the [installation steps](../../1-setup/attacker_VM/README.md "Attacker machine setup steps"), Nmap already comes installed.

## Check installation

To check Nmap is actually installed in the system, as well as the installed version, run the following command:

```bash
$ nmap --version
```
