# Tools installation

Here one can find the instructions to correctly install and configure the tools players have to use during the [first round](../../2-rounds/round_1 "First attacks rounds folder") of attacks.

Start by installing [Nmap](./1-Nmap "Nmap installation folder"), then [OpenVAS](./2-OpenVAS "OpenVAS installation folder"), and finally [FFUF](./3-FFUF "FFUF installation folder").
