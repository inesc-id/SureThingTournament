# CROSS-client setup

This folder contains instructions to install and setup the two virtual machines that should be instantiated in order to have a working deployment of the CROSS-client mobile application.
Its contens are described [later](./##cross-client-folder-structure "CROSS-client folder structure section").

## CROSS-client folder structure

This folder is divided in the following two sub-folders:

- [CROSS_client_code](./2-CROSS_client_code "CROSS-client mobiel application code folder"), contains the instructions to install and setup the virtual machine that will be used to provision the code of the CROSS-client mobile application to it;
- [CROSS_client_mobile_application](./1-CROSS_client_mobile_application "CROSS-client mobile application folder"), which contains all the necessary instructions to install and setup the virtual machine where the CROSS-client mobile application will run.

<br>

## Setup instructions order

Start by installing and setting up the virtual machine where the [CROSS-client mobile application](./1-CROSS_client_mobile_application "CROSS-client mobile application folder") will run on.
Only then move on to setup the [virtual machine that will hold and provision the code of the mobile application](./2-CROSS_client_code "CROSS-client mobile application code folder")
