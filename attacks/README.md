# Attacks results report

This folder contains two folders, one for each attack round.
Inside each of these two folders there should be folders for each of the attacks players perform.
For the [first round](./round_1 "First round results folder"), there are already separate folders for each of the attacks players are asked to perform.
In the case of the [second round](./round_2 "Second round results folder"), players must follow the same folder structure by adding any necessary folders for each attack performed.

Concerning both rounds, players must create README files (or write over the ones that already exist) inside each single attack folder to report the attack performed.
Each README file should describe how the attack was done along with an overview of the gathered results.
Also inside each attack folder, players must place any and all data produced (terminal logs, scripts, ...) for/during an attack **along** with the output produced by the CROSS-server during the time the attack took place.
If the produced data for an attack is in a single file then place it inside the corresponding attack foler **along** with the CROSS-server log output file.
Else, if that data is scattered in more than one file, then create a folder inside the attack folder and place each file with the produced data **along** with the corresponding CROSS-server output there.
